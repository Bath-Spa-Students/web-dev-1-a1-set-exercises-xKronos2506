        <h1>Rainbow 6 Siege</h1>
        <p>Rainbow Six Siege is the sixteenth installment on the Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Franchise developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft Entertainment. <br> 
            This is considered a successor to the cancelled <strong>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Patriots</strong>. This game is heavily inspired by counter-terrorist activity, both in reality and games around the world. R6 heavily emphasizes on both environmental destruction and cooperation between players, as well as application on real-life combat tactics like Close Quarter Combat as well as its realistic game mechanics. </p>

        <h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
        <p>Team Rainbow has been deactivated since 2012. In their absence, many new terrorist organizations emerged as a result. One such organization, the White Masks, came into prominence in 2015 by spreading chaos all across the world, sharing no discrimination with who they terrorize. With their ultimate objective unknown, they become a large enough threat that Team Rainbow was reactivated. Under the leadership of Aurelia Arnot, Operators were gathered from all across the world.After successfully stopping a biochemical attack on Bartlett University, Six performed a eulogy for those who had lost their lives in the attack and many like it but also told of how Team Rainbow was back and that they would be ready to defend the world where needed. In 2018, Aurelia Arnot resigned from the position of Six and was succeeded by Harry Pandey.</p>

        <h2 id="game-overview">Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Within the main game, the 5v5 combat, where the gameplay mechanic is the same as every tactical FPS game like CS2 and Valorant, where two opposing teams, 5 players each, are tasked to either defend or attack a point in the map. But unlike the two games mentioned, R6 provides dozens of so-called Operators to choose from, each hailing from different Counter-Terrorist Units from across the world. Only one Operator is to be chosen from each specialty per round and cannot be changed until the round is over. Each Operator is unique from their weapons, abilities to equipment. The match starts on said two opposing teams, Attackers and Defenders, which are given 45 seconds to both setup and recon: 
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attackers:</li>
                        <p>Attackers are given each round 45 seconds to send a Drone for reconnaissance on the whole map, from tracking the objective, locate enemies to mark up to further plan the position where they will breach. 
                        </p>
                    <li>Defenders:</li>
                    <p>During the 45 seconds given to the attackers, the Defenders are tasked to fortify their location to prepare for the inevitable assault by the Attackers. This is done through setting up Reinforced Walls and Barricades around the area, as well as deploying unique equipments by the operators to further help defend the area like Mute’s Signal Disruptors</p>
                </ul>
            </div>
        <div>
        <p>As stated, this game has fundamental realism as players have the ability to breach walls through planting explosives, create bullet holes on walls and more. This allows for a greater player experience as it could provide a greater tactical advantage to both opposing teams. 
            In addition, tactics are vital within this game, as application to real life situational combats also exist here, like Close Quarter Combat (CQB) tactics, Explosive Management, Breaching, Surprise Entry and more. 
            Finally, communication is important in the gameplay as much as the two fundamentals, as the key to succeeding is good teamwork and communication.

        <p>This game offers a character-based system for the players to choose from, called Operators. There are currently sixty-five available Operators, each hailing from various international Counter Terrorism Units (CTUs). There are two types of Operators: Attackers and Defenders. As their name implies, Attacking and Defending Operators feature unique skills and gadgets that are specialized for their respective role. This also applies to how much health or running speed an Operator may have.

            Players may choose one Operator per round. Additionally, once an Operator is chosen, it will be locked out from being chosen by other players.
